Built a _data set_________ that __achieves 82 or more accuracy________ using ___thonny _______, resulting in __a AI prediction score________.

## Problem
the problem is i need to create a data set that includes a row of numbers of hours slept and hours studided to input the AI on

## Solution
How does your project work? the project is to build a data of muiltple rows of data that includes how many hours a student has slept and how many hours they had spent on studying, the goal is to be able to build a clear and accurate data set for the AI to then use that data to result in a prediction of how many hours slept and studied will it take to achieve a higher score on a test, while also giving it its average

## Tools
in person help from instructor, Poe AI explaination.

## Results
What worked? the data set was able to be clear and accurate enough for the AI to come with the solution. the AI stated "The AI predicted a test score of 87.38632395732299 for a student who studied 6 hours and slept 8 hours."

## Learning
One important thing learned was the ability to solve a higher level of coding and being able to collect and create good data for accurate results.
